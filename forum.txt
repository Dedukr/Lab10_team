"Hello, everybody! Hope youre having great holidays. Ive got a question about connecting the front-
and the back-end of my web application together. I dont quite understand how they should interact
with each other to make it efficient and keep it simple. If someone has some real experience about
building a fullstack application I would love to know how it all works together. Thank you!"
